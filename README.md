Competitive Multi-Agent Simulation for A.I. Class

Here's my final (group) project for the third-year class "Introduction to Artifical Intelligence".

In this project I attempted to create a 2-dimensional simulation of a very very very simplified forest ecosystem. The ecosystem consisted of Plants (Producers), Deer (Herbivores),
and Wolves that look a bit like foxes (Carnivores).
